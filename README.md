# Using the power calculator gui
The "power_calculator.exe" is the program generated based on the code provided in gui.py
The gui is created using pyqt5. 

The gui still has some bugs. e.g. zero divison errors/crashes. 

The gui is based on the implementation of the calculatioon of a power system from "Fundamentals of Space Systems, 2nd edition" page. 412 and onwards. 
4 battery types has been added to choose between, but more can easily be added in the form of a dict.
The same goes for power systems and solar array types

The power calculator also taking into account all the efficiency losses for the given subsystems.
